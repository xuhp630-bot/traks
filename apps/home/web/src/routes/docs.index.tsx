            <strong>Goals</strong> turn a custom event or a page visit into a conversion with a rate
            against period visitors. Page goals accept a <Inline>/section/*</Inline> prefix; event
            goals can require a prop to equal a value (for example <Inline>plan = pro</Inline>).
            Outbound clicks, downloads, and 404s work as goals too.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Funnels</strong> chain two to eight ordered steps, each a page (or prefix) or an
            event with an optional prop condition, and show how many sessions reached each step and
            the drop-off between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Filters and segments</strong>: click any row in any panel to filter the whole
            dashboard by it; filters stack and live in the URL. Save the active combination as a
            named segment from the bookmark menu and re-apply it in one click.

            does not send email, so copy the invite link and share it yourself; it is pinned to that
